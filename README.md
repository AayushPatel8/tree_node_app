## Code Structure

All logic is in a single file for simplicity:

- **TreeNode Class:**  
  Represents each node; tracks parent, children, and position.

- **Responsive Utilities:**  
  `ResponsiveBreakpoints` and `ResponsiveDimensions` handle adaptive UI scaling.

- **TreePage Widget:**  
  Main stateful widget. Manages tree structure, theme, layout, and interactions.  
  Contains animation controllers for smooth UI transitions.

- **Custom Painters:**  
  - `_BackgroundPainter`: Draws faint grid background.
  - `_ConnectorPainter`: Draws connectors between nodes using smooth cubic paths.

- **UI Components:**  
  - App bar (with theme and GitHub controls)
  - Status bar (shows active node, depth, and total node count)
  - Watermark overlay (animated creator credit)
  - Node widgets with tap, scale, and delete controls

## Customization

- **Max tree depth:** Limited to 100 for performance.
- **Node appearance and colors:** Easily tweakable in the theme color getters.
- **Animations:** Controlled by `AnimationController` for nodes and watermark.
